00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:05.271
My family and I find ourselves
in an interesting situation.

2
00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:06.539
Can I help you?

3
00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:07.774
Looking for John Dutton.

4
00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.909
Yeah. Who's looking
for John Dutton?

5
00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:13.413
The walls are closing
in all sides.

6
00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.615
We're fighting to survive.

7
00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:19.652
Your father's ranch isn't
a kingdom and he isn't a king.

8
00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:21.855
Your family deserves
to lose everything.

9
00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.258
There are wolves
everywhere here.

10
00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.560
I run this valley.

11
00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:30.163
And there's a war coming.

12
00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:34.934
You bet your ass it's coming.

13
00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:40.407
This is where change begins.
With new partnerships.

14
00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:42.842
They will pull you.

15
00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.046
They will twist you
and tear you into tiny pieces.

16
00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.015
To beat her,
I have to attack him.

17
00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.384
I have to play dirty.

18
00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.421
We're about to find out
how big a role you play

19
00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:57.123
in this family, son.

20
00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.427
You understand what I'm asking.

21
00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:05.965
Loyalty, morality, not part
of the equation for you.

22
00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:07.700
I ran so far from this place,

23
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.469
I don't think
it factors in at all.

24
00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.575
This cannot be fixed.

25
00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:28.154
All the angels are gone son.
There's only devils left.
